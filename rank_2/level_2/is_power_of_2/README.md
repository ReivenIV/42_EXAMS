Write a function that determines if a given number is a power of 2.

This function returns 1 if the given number is a power of 2, otherwise it returns 0.

Your function must be declared as follows:

int	    is_power_of_2(unsigned int n);
```

# Personal notes: (non subjet part)

The is_power_of_2 function can be useful in various scenarios, particularly in computer science and programming contexts:

0. Just knowing if the given number is **even** or not. 

1. Memory Allocation:
- Ensuring that memory sizes are powers of 2 can optimize memory alignment and access speeds.

2. Bit Manipulation: (check v4)
- Powers of 2 have exactly one bit set in their binary representation, which is useful in bitwise operations and optimizations.

3. Algorithm Optimization:
-Certain algorithms, such as those in graphics, cryptography, and data structures (e.g., binary trees, heaps), can be optimized when working with sizes that are powers of 2.

4. Networking:
- In networking, buffer sizes and packet sizes are often powers of 2 for efficiency.
Game Development:

Powers of 2 are commonly used in texture sizes and other graphical assets for performance reasons.
