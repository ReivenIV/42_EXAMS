### Personal recomendations:
05/02/2025 Today after 4 tries i passed the exam rank 2. 

What i wanted to recomend or you can see it as some guidelines: 
- Yes there are a ton of exercices to learn, test, understand, de-bug
- Don't get overwhelmed. Just do it step by step.
- Do it on your own, take breaks and repeat them.
- On of the best recomendations is: **train and focus on level 3 and 4.**
	- lvl 1 and 2 (beyond the bits) are """""kinda e-a-s-y""""" don't waste time training like crazy on them.
- Remember in the exam you could end up with only 10 minutes or 20 minutes for the last exercices.
- Do the exam every week (even if you are not ready) 
- Don't waste time!! do the proyects aswell in pararel. (i waste 2 weeks training for the exam)
	- maybe morning train the exam and in the afternoon do the proyects.
